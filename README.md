I'm a Senior at the University of California, Santa Cruz, studying Computer Science: Computer Game Design.

I'm a programmer most of my experience is in C# and Javascript. I primarily focus on game design and procedural generation. Most of my time is spent in Godot.

You can play my games on my [itch.io page](https://lifehckr.itch.io/). Or from their respective repos.
