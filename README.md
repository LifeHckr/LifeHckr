### Jarod Spangler

A programmer experienced with C# and Javascript. I primarily focus on game design and procedural generation. Most of my time is spent in Godot.

I am the producer and lead programmer of [Midnight Riff](https://github.com/Project-Funk-Engine/ProjectFunkEngine)

The projects that show off some of my favorite work is [Pizza With Gun](https://github.com/LifeHckr/SpaghettiCodeInDarkMode), [WFC in Godot](https://github.com/LifeHckr/SpaghettiCodeInDarkMode), and [YACTT:YFBE](https://github.com/LifeHckr/1bit-Platformer).

You can play my games on my [itch.io page](https://lifehckr.itch.io/). Or from their respective repos.
