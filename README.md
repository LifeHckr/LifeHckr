### Jarod Spangler

I'm a Senior at the University of California, Santa Cruz expecting to graduate in June 2025, studying Computer Science: Computer Game Design.

I'm a programmer with most of my experience being in C# and Javascript. I primarily focus on game design and procedural generation. Most of my time is spent in Godot.

The projects that show off some of my favorite work is [Pizza With Gun](https://github.com/LifeHckr/SpaghettiCodeInDarkMode), [WFC in Godot](https://github.com/LifeHckr/SpaghettiCodeInDarkMode), and [YACTT:YFBE](https://github.com/LifeHckr/1bit-Platformer).

You can play my games on my [itch.io page](https://lifehckr.itch.io/). Or from their respective repos.
